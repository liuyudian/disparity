# disparity
This implementation takes in two images with epipolar rectification and computes the disparity between the images. For a stereo pair, intrinsic parameters must be known in order to rectify the images and in consecutive monocular images, both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters must be known for epipolar rectification.
